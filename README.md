# CVIP Data Science Internship Project Repository

Welcome to my internship project repository! This repository contains the files related to my internship tasks and projects. The tasks are divided into two phases, each consisting of a normal task and a golden task. Here's an overview of the tasks in this repository:

## Phase 1:
### Normal Task - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Terrorism
In this task, I have performed exploratory data analysis on a dataset related to terrorism. The aim was to gain insights into the patterns, trends, and factors associated with terrorism incidents. The analysis included data visualization, statistical summaries, and identifying correlations between different variables.

### Golden Task - Breast Cancer Prediction
For the golden task of Phase 1, I have worked on a breast cancer prediction project. Using machine learning techniques, I built a predictive model to classify breast cancer cases as benign or malignant based on a set of features. The model's performance was evaluated using various metrics to ensure its accuracy and reliability.

## Phase 2:
### Normal Task - Email Spam Detection
In this task of Phase 2, I have focused on email spam detection. By employing natural language processing and machine learning, I developed a model that can classify emails as either spam or legitimate. The model was trained on a labeled dataset and then tested for its effectiveness in differentiating between spam and non-spam emails.

### Golden Task - Speech Emotion Recognition
For the golden task of Phase 2, I delved into speech emotion recognition. Using audio processing techniques and deep learning models, I created a system that can identify different emotions conveyed in spoken language. The model's performance was evaluated on its ability to accurately recognize and classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more.
